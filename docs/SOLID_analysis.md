# SOLID Principles Analysis in the Bulb Manager Project

This document analyzes how the Bulb Manager project adheres to or deviates from the SOLID principles.

## SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of object-oriented design principles aimed at creating more maintainable, flexible, and understandable systems.

## Project Analysis

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Principle**: A class should have only one reason to change.

**Evaluation**: ✅ Respected

- The `Bulb` class is solely responsible for managing the state of a bulb.
- The `BulbService` class is solely responsible for service operations related to bulbs.
- The `BulbRepository` interface solely defines persistence operations.
- The `InMemoryRepository` class is solely responsible for the in-memory implementation of the repository.

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

**Evaluation**: ✅ Partially respected

- The use of the `BulbRepository` interface allows extending persistence functionality without modifying existing code.
- The Command pattern implementation with a sealed interface allows for type-safe command handling.
- However, the `Bulb` class could be improved to facilitate extension. For example, the `MAX_COUNTER` value is hardcoded and cannot be modified without changing the class.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Principle**: Objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program.

**Evaluation**: ✅ Respected

- The `InMemoryRepository` implementation respects the contract defined by the `BulbRepository` interface.
- There is no complex inheritance in the project that could violate this principle.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Principle**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

**Evaluation**: ✅ Respected

- The `BulbRepository` interface is minimalist and contains only the necessary methods.
- The `Command` interface is a marker interface with no methods, serving only to group related command types.
- There are no "fat" interfaces that would force clients to implement unnecessary methods.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Principle**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

**Evaluation**: ✅ Respected

- `BulbService` depends on the `BulbRepository` abstraction and not on the concrete `InMemoryRepository` implementation.
- Dependency injection is used to provide the concrete repository implementation to the service.
- Hexagonal architecture (ports and adapters) is used, with the domain at the center and infrastructure adapters on the outside.

## Conclusion

The Bulb Manager project generally respects the SOLID principles:

- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- ⚠️ Open/Closed Principle (partially respected)
- ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle
- ✅ Interface Segregation Principle
- ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle

**Strengths**:
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Use of interfaces for dependencies
- Well-implemented hexagonal architecture
- Command pattern implementation with sealed interfaces

**Improvement Suggestions**:
- Make the `Bulb` class more extensible, for example by allowing the maximum lifespan to be configurable
- Consider using immutable objects as mentioned in the roadmap
- Complete the implementation of the Decider pattern by separating decision logic from state evolution
