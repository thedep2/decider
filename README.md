# decider

A test of the decider pattern with spring modulith and pattern matching.

The goal of this project is to build a framework to implement the decider pattern in a spring modulith project.

Features:

A bulb can be switched on and switched off.
If it is already switched on, the bulb stays light on.
A bulb has a limited lifespan, if the bulb is switched on three times, the bulb went out.

To do:

- [ ] use commands
- [ ] object immutable
- [ ] split decider/evolve
- [ ] use an event between
- [ ] use a list of events
- [ ] initiale state
- [ ] terminal state
- [ ] persist lists of events
- [ ] event sourcing
- [ ] build framework
- [ ] module switch (two switches for one bulb)
- [ ] probably improve the framework
